/*
The print statement can be used with or without parentheses: print or print().

Echo can be used in expressions as it has no return value while print has a return value of 1.

The echo is used to display the output of parameters that are passed to it. It displays the outputs of one or more strings separated by commas. The print accepts one argument at a time & cannot be used as a variable function in PHP
